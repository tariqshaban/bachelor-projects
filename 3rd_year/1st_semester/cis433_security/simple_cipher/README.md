Simple Cipher
==============================

A Windows forms-based application that contains the following:

* A basic Caesar cipher implementation
* Encrypt/decrypt function
* Import text from .txt files
* Option to ignore symbols and spaces

Languages/Frameworks
------------

* WinForms, based on C#

Prerequisites
------------

* A Windows device
* .NET framework

Getting Started
------------

* Download the project's subdirectory from GitHub
  using [this link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/tariqshaban/bachelor-projects/tree/master/3rd_year/1st_semester/cis433_security/simple_cipher)

* Import the [Source Code](source_code) as a project in Visual Studio
* Run the [Release Executable](release_executable) if you wish to directly inspect the application on an Android device

Notes
------------

* The application is not optimized to handle large text, multi-threading implementation is strongly recommended
* The application re-encrypts that whole text while the user is typing, perhaps it is best to find a method which
  encrypts only the changes in the string
